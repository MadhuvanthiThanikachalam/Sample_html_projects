            <h3><em>DIRECTIONS:</em></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
                <li>Place potatoes in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic and thyme; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Gently toss to combine.</li>
                <li>Place into oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp; set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add eggs, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they just begin to set; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Continue cooking until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains, about 3-5 minutes. Top with cheese; set aside.</li>
                <li>Add bacon to the skillet and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                <li>Place broccoli florets into a steamer or colander set over a pan of boiling water. Cover and steam for 5 mins, or until cooked through and vibrant green.</li>
                <li>Place potatoes, eggs, bacon and broccoli into <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LIFT-Certified-BPA-Free-Microwavable-Containers/dp/B0128YT76S/">meal prep containers.</a></li>
